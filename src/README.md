## Introduction

I am currently an RA at the University of Science and Technology of China, supervised by Associate Professor Jianmin Ji.

My research interests include scenario-based autonomous vehicle safety assessment and KR-based traffic scenario representation and generation.

I'm interested in many robotics and autonomous driving fields, including reinforcement learning, motion planning, and trajectory optimization.

I hold a Master's degree in engineering with a major in computer science and technology, and a Bachelor's degree in engineering with a major in automation and control from the University of Science and Technology of China.
