# Résumé

## Introduction

I am an RA at the University of Science and Technology of China, supervised by Associate Professor Jianmin Ji.
My research interests include scenario-based autonomous vehicle safety assessment and KR-based traffic scenario representation and generation.
I'm also interested in many robotics and autonomous driving fields, including reinforcement learning, motion planning, trajectory optimization, and even hardware design.

## Highlights

- Experienced in scenario-based autonomous driving safety assessment methods
- Familiar with autonomous driving planning algorithms such as EM Planner and Lattice Planner
- Acquainted with reinforcement learning algorithms like DQN and PPO
- Proficient in logic programming based on Answer Set Programming
- Knowledgeable about control theory, circuit theory, embedded system development, and hardware design of robots
- Experienced in C/C++/Python/ROS/ROS 2
