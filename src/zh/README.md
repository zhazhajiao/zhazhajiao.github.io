## Introduction

I am a Master's student at the University of Science and Technology of China, supervised by Associate Professor Jianmin Ji. I'm expected to graduate in October 2024, and I'm looking for a PhD position now.

My research interests include scenario-based autonomous vehicle safety assessment and KR-based traffic scenario representation and generation.

I'm interested in many robotics and autonomous driving fields, including reinforcement learning, motion planning, and trajectory optimization.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in engineering with a major in automation and control from the University of Science and Technology of China.
